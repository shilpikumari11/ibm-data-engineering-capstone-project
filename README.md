## IBM Data Engineering Capstone Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the completion of the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate Capstone Project. Throughout this journey, I have gained practical hands-on experience in various aspects of data engineering. Here's a brief overview of the project:

- Designed and implemented OLTP and NoSQL databases for an E-Commerce website.
- Created a data warehouse schema based on OLTP and NoSQL databases.
- Developed ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data into the data warehouse.
- Built visualizations and dashboards using Cognos for data analysis and reporting.
- Deployed machine learning models on SparkML for sales projections.

This project encapsulates the culmination of skills acquired during the Data Engineering Professional Certificate program. Feel free to explore the code and documentation. Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated!
